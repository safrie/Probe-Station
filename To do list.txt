To do with program:
• Fix Keithley Errors/Issues
    a) on diffcon modify stop current: keith_ui_internal.update(d1) TypeError
        cannot convert dictionary update sequence element #0 to a sequence
    b) "Load" and "Save" buttons for config file do nothing
    c) Some sort of weird print-stuff @ meas type change
    d) For set_keith_curr1 -> self.keith_ui_internal.update(d1):
        cannot convert dictionary update sequence element #0 to a sequence
    e) Unsure if changing filter type works
    f) Test measurement with dummy resistor
    g) Implement input validation
        - design.py
        - setters in keith.py
    h) Fix any VISA issues
• Fix AMI 430 Errors/Issues
    a) On open of Magwindow, for spinbox.setValue(targ), targ is the bound
       method Mag.set_target, not an actual numerical value
    b) Implement logic for 'Record magnetic field' present in GUI but not
       elsewhere in program
        - Class variable in magnet.py
        - Signal/slot in main.py
        - Config file in main.py
    c) Get mag calibration file stuff up and running (low priority)
        - This is for loading/saving calibration curves FOR THE MAGNET
    d) Create get_header_string method
        - This is related to set_enable_trig and qenable_trig methods
    e) Fix any VISA issues
    f) Input validation
        - design.py
        - magnet.py
• Fix LakeShore 336 Errors/Issues
    a) Implement GUI and YAML control over wait time between measurements
        - Class variable in temperature.py
        - DoubleSpinBox and label in design.py
        - Signal/Slot in main.py
        - Config file in main.py
        - Config file in probe_station_params
    b) Implement logic for 'Record Temperature' present in GUI but not
       elsewhere in program
        - Class variable in temperature.py
        - Signal/slot in main.py
        - Setter in main.py
        - Config file in main.py
        - Config file in probe_station_params
    c) Create get_header_string method
    d) Fix any VISA issues
    e) Input validation
        - design.py
        - setters in temperature.py
• Add tooltips to:
    a) set_setpoints button
    b) set_ramps button
• Test config file stuff
    a) Make sure loading works for:
        - Keithley
        - LakeShore 336
        - AMI 430
        - All at once
    b) Make sure saving works for:
        - Keithley
        - LakeShore 336
        - AMI 430
        - All at once
•* Update probe_station_params.yaml
• Get graphing up and running
• Make sure closeEvents for windows deselect the selwindow buttons
• Make instrument testing environment so attribute errors stop
    a) Implement multi-parameter properties? (depends on dev response)
• FZF all TODO's and fix them.
