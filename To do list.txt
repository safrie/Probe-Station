To do with program:
• see if @property decorator useful for attributes I want to always have the return value of a 
  function call--useful instead of setter/getter methods(see: 
  https://treyhunner.com/2019/05/python-builtins-worth-learning/#The_5_debugging_functions)
  a) Propagate do_measure -> measure property (instrument_abc)
  b) Propagate do_control -> control property (instrument_abc)
  c) Propagate set_address -> address property (instrument_abc)
  d) Change a bunch of dicts over to properties so that they update when
     properties within them are updated.
  e) Rename temperature.measure() because it conflicts with the measure property
  ✗) Propagate keith.unit_idx -> keith.unit (main)
• Fix Keithley Errors/Issues
    a) on diffcon modify stop current: keith_ui_internal.update(d1) TypeError
        cannot convert dictionary update sequence element #0 to a sequence
    b) "Load" and "Save" buttons for config file do nothing
    c) Some sort of weird print-stuff @ meas type change
    d) For set_keith_curr1 -> self.keith_ui_internal.update(d1):
        cannot convert dictionary update sequence element #0 to a sequence
    e) Unsure if changing filter type works
    f) Test measurement with dummy resistor
    g) Implement input validation
        - UI updaters in main.py
    h) Fix any VISA issues
    i) Change all internal variables to A for ease of switching scales
        - test_environment.yaml
    j) pulse delta pulse delay is fucked up (all)
        - spinbox acting like seconds, not microseconds
    k) pulse delta cycle int/meas rate fucked up
        - also the pulse delta sweeps cycle int/cycle time fucked
        - "PDeltaLog" object has no attribute 'meas_rate'
    l) pulse delta pulse width fucked up
        - spinbox acting like seconds, not microseconds.
    m) pulse delta stair count fucked up
    n) Debug KeithMeasure.set_num_points when overflows b/c update_num_points
    o) pulse delta stair sweep count missing from arm statement
    p) delta measurement rate not set correctly in spinbox initially
    q) delta pulse count spinbox tops out at 99--make bigger?

• Fix AMI 430 Errors/Issues
    a) Remove everything related to magnets in this software.
    b) main
    c) limits.py

• Fix LakeShore 336 Errors/Issues
    a) Implement GUI and YAML control over wait time between measurements
        - Class variable in temperature.py
        - DoubleSpinBox and label in design.py
        - Signal/Slot in main.py
        - Config file in main.py
        - Config file in probe_station_params
    b) Implement logic for 'Record Temperature' present in GUI but not
       elsewhere in program
        - Class variable in temperature.py
        - Signal/slot in main.py
        - Setter in main.py
        - Config file in main.py
        - Config file in probe_station_params
    c) Create get_header_string method
    d) Fix any VISA issues
    f) Add "warm" button to GUI
    g) temperature.py line 112 info.out.name[1] has no attribute 'name'
• Add tooltips to:
    a) set_setpoints button
    b) set_ramps button
• Test config file stuff
    a) Make sure loading works for:
        - Keithley
        - LakeShore 336
        - AMI 430
        - All at once
    b) Make sure saving works for:
        - Keithley
        - LakeShore 336
        - AMI 430
        - All at once
•* Update probe_station_params.yaml
• Get graphing up and running
• Make sure closeEvents for windows deselect the selwindow buttons
✗ Make instrument testing environment so attribute errors stop
    a) Implement multi-parameter properties? (depends on dev response)
• FZF all TODO's and fix them.

· Design:
    - Make sure all defaults are loaded correctly (especially the Keithley 
    section)

Current Branch: input-validation
