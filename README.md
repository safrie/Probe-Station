Software for running Keithley 6221/2182a stack and LakeShore 336 Temperature Controller

This software is still in development and is currently a "learning" project.

The scripts in LakeShore_336 work well for basic temperature measurement and control. The Keithley2182a_6221 scripts need to be finalized and tested. Through the GUI, loading and saving configuration files works, but graphing has not been implemented yet, and data saving needs to be tested.

I am currently using this project to learn about how Python properties and how they can be useful for things such as input validation and automatically updating variables stored in a dictionary.
